A mixed collection of "fairly general" convenience functions I use across different project.
The functions are structured with respect to the existing module they extend, or the functionality they facilitate. 
Some examples are:

* numpy
  * wrapper for shapes and axes
* matplotlib (mpl)
  * settings to produce scientific figures (tex + pdf)
  * advanced interactive capabilities
    * draggable patches
    * key listener for sliders
* multiprocessing
  * general wrapper to multiprocess an arbitrary function
* math
  * finite differences
* geometry
* spatial transforms
  * 
* read / write files
* lists, tuples, dicts
* timing

This repo has nothing to do with [Werkzeug](https://pypi.org/project/Werkzeug/). 
They just seem to have the same humor.
